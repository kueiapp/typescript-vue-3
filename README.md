# typescript-vue-3
Vue3 was offically released 1.0 [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0?fbclid=IwAR11tiT4UK2WHkBgR6O--7fF8nwPzfGV-U-N7lSz8FjKsYl32mwEtn21FQA) with [docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#getting-started)

Vue3 is basically same as using composition API on vue2 with other [samples](https://github.com/kueiapp/vue2-typescript-composition), but with fundamental improvement for performance.

Using Vue3 on Vue-cli is needed to upgrade to [~4.5 here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/releases/tag/v4.5.6)
